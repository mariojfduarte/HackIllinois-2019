This is a visual of the Optimal Path based on an employee id and and an Implementation of the Traveling Salesman problem. According to our method this is very close to the optimal path for this one employee to take. If another nurse were to run this algorithm they would get a different result based on thier start position. The start position could be something like the office or the nurse's home.
